# Sephora-Product-ExploratoryDataAnalysis

## Objective
Utilizing consumer insight statistics such as product rating scores and number of reviews, I wanted to analyze what were the most popular products, product categories, and brands on the US Sephora website. From there, I also wanted to understand the tangible impacts virality had on user behaviour towards a product listing, such as the variance in product ratings and number of reviews between popular and less popular products.
